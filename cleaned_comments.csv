You can expect a response by 10 a.m. the next business day for requests sent outside of business hours. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank The partner sent this via email without many details. A NetSuite search identified SO158855 as the record with an outstanding balance. I updated ticket fields with the details. The order was placed today (4/28/2024). There was a grant applied but it did leave a 172.27 balance. I do not know how to look up which grant was applied and if there are still funds available to cover this balance. Brad Good afternoon, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that you can only apply one grant to a single line item. Currently, you have a remaining balance of $30.17 on your 1-H grant, which the system is trying to use to cover the cost of your 300015 Macaroni & Cheese. If you order a line item that costs more than $30.17, you will still have a balance. However, if you would like to use your other grant, which has a larger balance and can cover the entire line item cost of $202.44, we can arrange that for you so that you won't have any remaining balance to pay for this sales order. Please let me know which grant you would like to use, and I will put in a ticket with my IT team to make the necessary changes. Thank you, Daniele use I-I to cover the balance. Do I have to order something for 30.17 to use that grant?,,]},,,]}],""attrs"":} Yes- you would need to order something that amount or less to use that grant and get the item covered, or it can still be applied; you will just have a balance afterward. You may order an item that is $50, and you will owe $20 afterward- in this case, the difference is larger so I will request that they use your larger grant. When this is complete I will let you know. The IT team has made this change. If you edit the order, it will revert back to the original coverage, so please let me know if you plan on editing it. will probably not. Good evening, Your grants have been applied to cover the entirety of your order. You have no remaining balance due. Thank you, ""D"""

51,"Good Evening Zelda, Unfortunately, since I cannot see pending orders I cannot precisely say what the issue is. My initial thought is that the balance could be for an item that is not grant eligible, such as a donated item. Are all items on your order grant eligible? If you believe they are, screenshots would be helpful in determining what the issue might be. As a reminder, your cart will clear at midnight, so if you do want to reserve the items you will need to place by midnight tonight. Best, RC Hi Zelda, Just checking in! Can I offer any additional support? Best, RC I have not heard back from you, so I am going to close this ticket. If you need further support, please don t hesitate to reach back out. Best, RC"
52,"Hi Zelda, The actual delivery date for that item is 6/24! Apologies for the confusion. Best, Riley Riley, that works out perfectly. One other question, I selected allowable quantities of the fresh produce and saved it to my cart. I went back to lessen the quantity of an item and selected save. Logged back in to see if there was any fruit available and discovered I now have all these errors indicating the fresh vegetables are no longer available. I thought if we saved it in our box, it would be there. On Jun 13, 2023, at AM, RC wrote: Hi Zelda, I saw that you submitted a separate ticket for this matter and that my colleague ""D"" responded. If you need any additional support, please let me know. Best, RC"
53,"Good morning Zelda, I hope you are doing well. One of a few things could be happening. 1.) If you are in editing mode, which means you clicked Edit Order and you are viewing your card- there will be error messages saying that there are zero availability because there is no more left of that item to add to your order. Whatever you had on your order before starting to edit the order is secured but the error message is saying that there is no more of this item available to add more of. 2.) If you did not hit save, which I see that you said you did- then you could have lost of the items. Previously, the old system held in the carts for 24 hours, but that is no longer the case. 3.) The last instance is that throughout the day, our warehouse team members are continuously doing quality checks. If for any reason produce fails that quality check or the warehouse team deems it as not being able to make it (quality wise) to the date it's supposed to be delivered it can be taken off of your order. I am looking at your order and I do see eggplant, potatoes, cucumbers and squash on your orders. ""D"" thanks so much for explaining. I was excited for a very brief moment and then it just disappeared with the produce. Oh well maybe next month. On Jun 13, 2023, at PM, DH wrote: No problem, I apologize that that happened.

Once you complete the checkout process, your items are put on a sales order and finalized. The emails you receive are due to potential errors in our inventory or the pulling process that may cause changes to your order before delivery. This can happen for two main reasons. Firstly, if the pulling team finds that the item's quality is not up to our standards for delivery, it may be removed from your order or the quantity decreased. This can occur when partners place orders well in advance and by the time the order is picked, the item may no longer meet our quality standards. Secondly, if we run out of a certain product, this could be due to periodic inventory errors where the actual count of items doesn't match what's on the menu. While we strive to minimize these occurrences, we send email notifications to keep partners informed in case such changes are necessary before their order is fulfilled. Thank you, ""D"" Hi, makes sense. I received some side eye looks from those I love so much. I tried to explain the selection was slim, and that I believed it to be secure.

These items are sorted by our volunteer teams or donated in bulk. While our volunteers are instructed not to include expired foods, items that are past their ""best by"" or ""sell by"" dates are considered acceptable for consumption and may still be included. We encourage all partners receiving these donated cases to be aware of this and to use the Food Coding Guide created by our Food Resources team and Nutrition Department. Additionally, we recommend using your knowledge of food safety and your senses (sight, smell, and texture) to determine if the food is in good condition. I apologize for not being able to provide further guidance on this matter. The nature of donated products, especially assorted bins, makes it difficult to pinpoint a specific expiration date for a mix of different items. Thank you, ""D"""

127,"Good afternoon, Angela, I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding our delivery process. I will connect with our Transportation Team to clarify the issue and explore ways to improve it. Each morning, our Transportation Leadership prints out the day's sales orders, which should include the notes you and your team leave. I will double-check to ensure this process is still in place, as we established a notes section specifically for partners to provide important information for our drivers. Additionally, I want to mention that there are times when drivers may finish their deliveries earlier than expected, or we may have more drivers available than anticipated. In such cases, drivers are instructed to call you to ask if you would like to receive your order before your scheduled delivery window. If you decline, they should wait until your designated delivery window. I will reach out to confirm these details and will follow up with you. I understand that the current situation is not ideal and the implications it has on your distribution. Best regards, ""D"" Good afternoon, Angela, I just spoke with Joe, the Transportation Manager. He informed me that he discussed the delivery process and the expectation for courtesy calls with the driver who made your delivery yesterday, as well as the team of drivers during their morning meeting today. Joe confirmed that drivers should be able to see the notes you leave on your sales orders. More importantly, it is mandatory for them to call all partners before their deliveries, even if they are within the designated delivery window. This call is to inform you that they are on their way. In instances where drivers can make earlier deliveries, they must consult with you first to see if you can accommodate the earlier arrival; if not, they are expected to wait until the agreed delivery window. If you continue to experience issues regarding this matter, please let me know, and I will arrange for Joe to give you a call to discuss it further. Best, ""D"""

163,"!Outlook-A picture .png|thumbnail! Good afternoon, Grace, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her. I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub. When I spoke to Austin, she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order. They need to be mindful that they don t want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them. Here are two key points I discussed with Austin: 1. Currently, we do not have a formal limit for orders, so we cannot tell them what a limit would be. Operations and ERP/IT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders, the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately. For example, two weeks ago, Capital Christian s order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot, which is unrealistic. For now, we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations. 2. Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hub's participating sites resulting in a loss of produce we can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order. However, this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two. We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue. I hope this clarifies the situation, and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner. Best, ""D"""

Thank you in advance Good afternoon, Thank you again for bringing up this question. I have spoken to our Operations Manager in the DC warehouse, and unfortunately, we are unable to unstack or repack the pallets of produce in a different manner due to the truck's space capacity and efficiency reasons. Packing the pallets differently would require sending multiple trucks, causing inefficiency, and we also do not have the bandwidth to unstack and unpackage the cases and pallets of produce for each partner participating in the produce hub. One suggestion is that your agency acquire a pallet jack during the next round of capacity grants to assist with this issue.

198,"Good afternoon Godwin, This year, our Food Procurement Team purchased two truckloads of turkeys, each at a cost of approximately $60 to $70 per case and were available on PartnerLink. These turkeys have been allocated to various orders and are no longer available. I reached out to my colleagues on the Food Resources Team, who informed me that we often receive donated turkeys. These donations will be provided at no cost now that the shared mainte ce fee has been waived for donated items. However, we cannot predict if and when these donations will arrive. Typically, individuals and organizations tend to donate turkeys closer to Thanksgiving, usually in the week before the holiday or during the holiday week itself. Please continue to check the menu regularly to see if turkeys are added. If we do receive them, they will be added to the menu and available to partners on a first-come, first-served basis. Thank you, DH Harmon. Thank you for your response. We buy Turkey every year from CAFB in bulk you can check your record. I think our organization should have been given some consideration during the sharing of 2 trucks load of Turkey. We don't rely on donations we buy our Turkey every year. We observed that since Elvis left we have been having issues inrespect of our order, this is very unfair. Our community are expecting thanksgiving Turkey from us only to disappoint them at the end. Regards, Godwin Binutu Good afternoon Godwin, I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for reaching out to me again regarding the turkey availability. I completely understand how important this is for your community, especially during the holidays. I want to clarify that all the turkeys we receive are available on a first come, first served basis for all our partners, just like other items on the menu. I also realize that in previous years, there was a fee associated with our donated turkeys (0.19 cents per pound). However, I m pleased to share that this fee has been waived for this fiscal year, so it s possible you may have paid in the past but you would not have to this time for the donated product. I genuinely want to ensure that you and your clients receive the support you need this holiday season. I understand how quickly these items can disappear from the menu, and I encourage you to check it daily, as we frequently add new products. Right now, we also have vegetable oil, stuffing mix, corn muffin mix, canned collard greens, and beans that might help supplement your holiday distributions. Please feel free to check the menu regularly, and if I see any additional turkeys come available, I will reach out to you. Thank you for your understanding, and know that we are here to support you and your community during this important time.

Thank you! Hello Godwin, I m sorry to hear that you feel you haven t gotten the service you would like since there have been changes in staff. I would be happy to connect with you to discuss any challenges you are having. Regarding the turkeys, unfortunately, we don t have the capacity to track every partner that has received turkeys in the past, and it wouldn t be fair to our other partners to reserve inventory for a select few. However, there are times when we will receive a donation that is specifically allocated for the DC region. While this isn t a guarantee that we will receive such a donation, nor a promise to reserve anything, the regional team has made note of your interest and will notify you if we receive a special donation of turkeys for the region. As ""D"" mentioned, I also encourage you to continue checking PartnerLink so you will be aware as new items are added. Please let me know if you have any further questions for the DC regional team. Thank you for your continued partnership and the work you are doing to serve our community. Best, Laura Closing this ticket and responding to his other open ticket you for your assistance."

Any idea what's going on? Todd College Park Community Food Bank Hello, I was able to look into your account further and it seems you have exceeded your Produce Limit for this month. Your agency is currently allocated 2,000lbs per month for produce and you currently have ordered 2,700 between SO185617 and SO186567. This would prevent you from adding any additional produce to your orders for the month. , Ah, okay, thanks for confirming the 2,000lb limit.

I just edited the SO, so hopefully it will be adjusted soon. Since CAFB is closed today, I will be sure to let Partner Support know that the produce I added to SO189320 is for the hub and should not count towards your produce limit once we reopen.

I spoke to our IT Department this morning and wanted to relay some of the information that we discussed. First, the reason that you are unable to invoice your orders is because your agency has a balance over 90 days which means that your invoicing capabilities have been removed. Your agency s balance is $2,254.84. Until this amount is paid off, we will not be able to invoice any of your orders. Secondly, because we are unable to invoice your orders. We internally cannot place an order for you because we don't have access to your card information. I confirmed with our IT Team that the max number of items that PartnerLink will allow you to check out with is 21. The quantities do not play a factor into this, just the number of items themselves. If you are able to, please check out and place two orders to ensure you get all your items by place two orders that have 21 items. For reference, this is an issue that our IT Team is currently working on fixing so that we do not have to do this continuously. Please let me know if you have any questions. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.

Please let me know if you need any other information. Thank you Good afternoon accepts donations with items past their best by and sell by dates. The best by date is an indicator of the quality of a product but is not a safety date. The sell by date is for inventory management and tells the store for how long to display the product for sale. The product can still be consumed after this date. It's important to note that many of our donated products will be past these dates, but they are not expired and are still safe for consumption. We have food coding guides that partners can print and reference during distributions. When available, they can be ordered in English and Spanish from our Nutrition Education Department. The dates on some products may cause concerns for partners and their clients, but we urge you all to differentiate between the different dates on products, use the food coding guide as a reference, and also use your best judgment as well as your food safety knowledge. If you have a product that is not of the right consistency, has an odor, or you believe to be not okay, please let us know and discard the item immediately. As we increase our donations, we may encounter some challenges, but please work with us and continue to provide us with feedback. Additionally, if you ever have an issue with fresh produce, please include photos of the items so that we can forward them to our Operations and Food Resourcing Departments for their knowledge. We appreciate your partnership with us in this. For Nutrition Materials including the Food Coding Guide, please email: ""D"""

395,"Good afternoon, Thank you for contacting our Customer Service. I'd be happy to assist you with your query. Our system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, meaning only one grant can be applied to each line item. In your past couple of orders, you have had line items with high numbers ranging from $250 to $2,653.30. The system is going to use the grant that has enough available funds which might not be the one with the closest expiration date. Please see below: You have three grants: 1-G $3,000 (Expires 1^st^) SO136067 used $890.00 SO122558 used $812.60 Remaining Balance: $514.98 1-H $2,378 (Expires 2^nd^) SO146902 used $762.58 SO142621 used $1,498.84 Remaining Balance: $116.58 1-I $6,564 (Expires 3^rd^) SO157471 (your most recent order) was placed and totaled in $854.20, the only grant that could cover the entirety of this line item for the chicken was your 1-I grant. If the system pulled from either of your other two grants, it would not cover the total cost of the chicken. I hope this clarifies the situation.

555,"qm: Hi for assistance. We will reply as soon as possible. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank Good afternoon, Thank you for contacting customer support. I am looking into the dates for your previous orders to confirm that they are safe to eat. As a reference, feel free to use our Food Coding Guide (attached) as a resource when navigating different dates. I will follow up with you as soon as I get updates regarding the products you asked about. Hi Andrea, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to talk to you about the ticket you submitted. I apologize for the delay. One of my team members brought up your concerns regarding some items you received from us. After discussing your concerns about the salad dressing with my management and the Food Sourcing Team responsible for all the food that comes into the Food Bank, here are some points I wanted to share with you. Regarding the salad dressing, our Food Resourcing Team does not have a specific recommendation for shelf-stable milk or salad dressing in our Food Coding Guide. We suggest following the USDA's recommendation regarding this product specifically and apologize for not being able to provide further insight. Partners and clients should use their eyes, noses, and, taste buds to determine if a food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. Of course, if a product is showing any signs of spoilage such as rot, mold, foul odor, etc., we will accept a return. I have brought this issue to management's attention, and I agree that our Food Coding Guide needs improvement. I will raise this with our leadership for further review. In response to your second point, I acknowledge the importance of best-by dates for our partners and their clients. However, our team faces challenges in obtaining these dates for donated products. One challenge arises during packing events when volunteers check and pack donated items into cases labeled as assorted on the menu. These assorted cases contain items from various donors and are packed without specific best-by date information for each individual product. Another challenge occurs when we receive donated products in different case lots-with different dates, making it difficult to provide accurate best-by dates to our partners. We don't know what case lot your order is going to be pulled from until its pulled the day before or two before its delivered or picked up. Although we practice FIFO (first in, first out) inventory management, the dynamic nature of our inventory makes it challenging to predict best-by dates with certainty. As our inventory of donated products increases, we are committed to improving our processes to provide partners with the information they need to make informed decisions. We are continuously seeking ways to improve our processes, and I encourage partners to participate in the upcoming Partner meetings in July to address any questions or recommendations regarding product dates. Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. Warm regards, ""D"""

We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week, but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability. During the winter months, for example, we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available. In recent weeks, the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes, apples, and carrots. Due to producelimitations placed on agencies, our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets, but this remains an ongoing challenge. Currently, all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink, as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups. I have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation. First, you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date. I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce. You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment, which is three business days prior to the shipment date. This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10-day window. Another option is to explore our TEFAP program, a government-subsidized initiative through which participating partners can access additional items to supplement their regular orders. Please note that this program has specific requirements and is managed by the TEFAP team. For more information, you can reach out to Zaynab, the DC TEFAP coordinator: Thank you! Best regards, ""D"""

For our DDP programs (mobile and community markets), the recall outreach process differs from that of the partnership teams. When a recall is identified, our Food Resources, Analytics, and Operations Teams collaborate with our programs and my team (Customer Relations) to contact the partners who ordered the affected items. It is then the partners' responsibility to reach out to their clients. For DDP, the process is slightly different. I recommend contacting Jessica Arias, one of our managers on the DDP team, to learn more about how they notify their sites and assist those sites in informing their respective clients.

This date indicates when the product will be at its best flavor or quality and is not a safety date. It s a quality date that encourages consumers to eat food while it is in its prime state. Food that is past this date is not bad and should not be thrown away. We provide a food coding guide to our partners that explains these dates further. We want to reassure you that the peanut butter is not expired and will not cause any harm to consumers. We offer the Food Coding Guides as a resource and we have them printed and available to order for partners as well to pass out at distributions. Thank you, ""D"""

673,"Good afternoon, Thank you for contacting our Customer Service. I'd be happy to assist you with your query. Our system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, which means that only one grant can be applied to each line item. In the case of your order, the line item is $817.00, and the system initially used the last of your FY24 MD Region Moco 1-G grant, which was $75.59. However, as per your request, I have contacted our IT department to apply your FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-I grant to that line item since it is the only grant you have that can cover the entire amount. Please note that moving forward, the $75.59 remaining on your 1-G grant and the $18.01 left on your 1-H grant may not cover the entire line item cost. If this happens, it is because our system applies the grants on a per-line-item basis. If you have a line item that costs less than these amounts in future orders, then you will have no remaining balance. I hope this clarifies the situation. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask. Best regards, ""D"" Do you plan on making any further changes to this order? If our IT department fixes this, and you add to the order it will revert back to the grant coverage you see now.

704,"Hi for assistance. We will reply as soon as possible. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank Good morning, Thank you for your questions about the limited items on the menu. While I don't have a general answer, there are several factors at play. Firstly, at certain times of the year, we have constraints on our receiving calendar, which leads to fewer inventory trucks due to scheduling conflicts. Currently, we are facing this situation as we were closed for Juneteenth, went through our bi-annual inventory last week, and will also be closed for the July 4th observance next week. Additionally, as we prepare for our move back to home building in the Virginia region, there may be a slight shift in the amount of products as we transition inventory from one location to another. This means we have been and will continue to receive fewer trucks than usual and are trying to schedule loads that fit within this restricted schedule. Moreover, while donations vary, we are actively working to increase the amount of donated food we receive and make it available through our Partner Direct Program and the menu. This issue will be discussed in an upcoming in-person partner meeting in July, giving partners the opportunity to hear from our leadership and our Food Resourcing Team, who are responsible for sourcing all the food on the menu, both donated and purchased. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thanks, ""D"""

716,"Hey Erin, I just spoke with the partner and confirmed all of the quantities with them and they said they d like to keep them as is and will distribute multiples to clients CiArra is that okay from a TEFAP regulations perspective? There are no regulations limiting how much a partner can order, but I really do not think these quantities are reasonable. They have ordered 1,121 CASES of fruit (300 nectarines, 513 plums, 308 peaches), but they distribute to 280-350 households. This means that each household would receive at least 3 CASES of fruit. That s in addition to the CAFB produce that they ve also ordered. This is really excessive.

725,"qm: Good morning Jeanette, I hope you re doing well today. I was very concerned to hear about the issues you ve encountered with mice droppings and the presence of mice near the food you received from us. Please know that I am genuinely sorry for this distressing experience, and I want to extend my heartfelt apologies on behalf of Capital Area Food Bank and our Customer Service and Operations Team. This morning, I forwarded the information you provided in your ticket, along with your photos, to our Director of Operations. She is taking this matter very seriously and has scheduled a meeting with her team to ensure we find a prompt and effective resolution. They will be focusing on maintaining cleanliness and ensuring rodent protection in our facilities, as well as inspecting our warehouse products, particularly those in question, to ensure they are removed if necessary. I want to support you through this situation. Could you please let me know which specific products you needed to be disposed of due to the potential rodent issue, aside from the bins of cereal? I understand how disruptive this can be to your food distribution efforts, and I truly empathize with the challenges it presents in providing safe and healthy food to the community you serve. I will also reach out to my supervisor to discuss possible compensation for the inconvenience caused by this situation, as we value your partnership and want to make things right. Thank you for your understanding, and once again, I m truly sorry for the trouble this has caused. We are committed to resolving this matter as quickly as possible. Best wishes, ""D"" ""D"", Thank you so much for your prompt response and for addressing this matter with great regard. We look forward to hearing back from your side the resolution made from your side so this situation can be avoided. When it comes to your questions around damages and pain points that we encounter to intervene quickly here are some of the damages it costs my operations: We disregard about 50 Rx Boxes that were packed and ready for distribution to our Food as Medicine Program (this is worth $25 each box) We halted our packing operations (2 days' worth) and had caused me loss of 500 Rx Boxes that should have been packed last week. Instead, we used the time to do a deep cleaning to ensure all our 800 Rx Boxes are safe. We also use two additional days of work to contain and capture the three mice and safely throw the 2 bins of assorted cereals out of our building premises (into a landfill). (Note: I personally set aside my own list of tasks to help my team do this work for two days and also recruit four people to assist us with this problem) I hope this helps you and your organization understand how this type of matters can cause a small organization like ours not only inconvenience/stress but lost of products/investment/productivity for some of our programs outside our Food Pantry operations. ---- I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out personally to follow up on the recent incident and to express my sincere apologies for any disruption it may have caused you. I have escalated this matter to our Operations Director, and I want you to know that we have a new leader in Operations who is dedicated to ensuring we serve our partners with the utmost care and precision. She is committed to making improvements and has assured me that we are taking significant steps to prevent such situations from occurring in the future. Some of the measures we re implementing include: 1. Continuing our routine pest control efforts. 2. Collaborating with our pest control company, which visited our facility on Monday to conduct additional work beyond our normal mainte ce. 3. Strengthening our inspection processes to ensure that all pullers, drivers, and inspectors thoroughly check every order once it's staged. 4. Focusing on the quality of products going out to our partners. 5. Preparing for the warmer months ahead to maintain a rodent-free and clean environment for the food we deliver. I truly empathize with the impact this situation may have had on your operations, and I want to assure you that we are committed to providing a better service moving forward. Please know that we value your partnership and appreciate your understanding during this time. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to waive the delivery fees for both your recent order and your upcoming order on March 3rd. If you have any questions or concerns, please don t hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is important to us, and we re here to help. Thank you for your understanding.

I contacted our Food Resourcing Team, and they told me that they are unable to catalog the expiration dates for the chicken because of how much we get and the quantity of packs in each bin. They have reached out to our donors who supply our chicken to let them know about the outdated product. Generally, they are only able to give us product from the last calendar year and it should not be spoiled after being thawed out. We apologize for this inconvenience. ""D"" The chicken is frozen before its expiration date. Foods stored in the freezer remain safe almost indefinitely, and even if they are not stored as low as 0 F or below, they will still last much longer than the suggested times. The expiration date, or use-by date, on food helps to estimate the expected timeframe that the food will still be at its highest quality."

This feature is crucial for maintaining accurate information about your agency's operating hours, which in turn updates our [Get Help Map| on the website. The Get Help Map is a tool that clients use to locate nearby CAFB Partners, so it's essential to have the correct hours displayed. If you were unable to attend the trainings, don't worry. There are alternative options available, such as accessing the resource on PartnerLink under the Partner Resources tab, or signing up for [Customer Relations Office Hours| held every Wednesday from 10am-11am. Please note that due to the nature of the training, there are no recordings or slides available, as it involved a live demo and Q&A session. While partners are not being reprimanded for not attending a training, it's important to highlight that starting October 1st, partners who have not updated or confirmed their hours will see a banner prompting them to do so before placing an order. You will need to take this action to proceed with making an order. If your hours have not changed, simply verify them by accessing the Agency Overview section after clicking your agency name on PartnerLink. If changes are necessary, please update them accordingly. For further assistance, please contact us at So I went and clicked verify. Are we good now? Thanks, Jeff Yes, you are good.

This means that if you had an 8 AM - 10 AM delivery, it will now be scheduled for 10 AM - 12 PM. If we face a complete closure due to the weather, there will be no deliveries or pickups. On such days, the Customer Relations team will be available to reschedule deliveries and reach out to all partners regarding their orders.

We are contacting you to inform you that you have exceeded your produce limit by 1,750lbs. At this time, no action is needed and no removals are required; this message is simply to notify you of the overage. Thank you, Customer Relations Morning, I am confused by your message and unsure of its meaning and impact on current and future requests. Will the pallet that I recently ordered be delivered on the requested date, January 23rd. Does the weight prevent me from ordering in the future? Please advise. Paula Porter Metropolitan Baptist Church I am happy to provide further insight. The pallet you ordered will not be removed from your order and will be delivered on the 21st. However, this pallet has exceeded your agency s produce limit of 250lbs. At this time, due to the transition of implementing produce limits, we are not removing any produce from orders even if it exceeds their limit to allow partners to adjust. Once partners are more familiar of this process, we will begin adjusting orders, in communication with you, to have your orders align closer to your monthly allotted poundage. You are able to continue submitting orders as your agency allows, but for the rest of this or any month, you will no longer be eligible to order more produce once the limit has been met or exceeded. Please reach out to your Regional Team should you feel like an adjustment would be most beneficial for your agency. Hope this helps! Morning , I wanted to confirm our conversation last week, that my order, S0191939 which includes a produce pallet, will be changed from pickup to delivery. I received my CAFB confirmation email yesterday and it reflects pickup. Please advise if I need to take any further steps to ensure delivery. Thank you so much for all your support.

879,"Good morning Mitilde, I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your feedback with us; it is very valuable. I will follow up with the Transportation Leadership Team to address the way the drivers communicate with partners about this issue. To provide some context, there are two main reasons why drivers may not take pallets when dropping off food during a delivery. Firstly, they may have food for an immediate order or need to pick up food from another site for the warehouse, which means they cannot have food and pallets on the truck at the same time due to food safety (Pallets are often leftoutside- on the ground, possibly in the rain, and are often dirty) and consideration for our partners. Secondly, our drivers may be on tight schedules and do not have the time for a pallet pickup due to their busy delivery schedules, especially during the busy season. There is no reason why a driver could not explain this to you at the time, and I will ensure that this information is communicated to them. I apologize for your experience. Thank you, ""D"" I spoke with the Transportation Supervisor, and she mentioned that she received feedback about the pallets not being stacked properly and having trash around them. She has scheduled a pallet pickup for tomorrow. Please make sure that the pallets are stacked together to allow the equipment to pick them up easily, there is no debris around them, and they are placed on concrete, not on grass. Thank you! qm: This is how the pallets were placed. We can t stack them any higher, so we have to put them to the side due to our limited space. The driver was rude, which is unusual, as we ve always had great relationships with all the other drivers. Thanks for picking the pallets soon.

As stated in our SMART Shopping Policy, orders that contain only TEFAP products do not incur a delivery fee. However, orders that mix TEFAP with purchased or donated products do have a delivery fee associated with them. I do not have the ability to remove delivery fees from all orders, as these fees are automatically added when partners place their orders. I believe we will need to submit an ERP ticket to stop this charge permanently, as it is an automated process. To clarify what the ticket would entail: Are we asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions? Additionally, will we need to issue refunds for past orders that were charged delivery fees due to the mix of TEFAP and other products? I anticipate that partners will inquire about previous orders that included these fees as we proceed with this change and it also may be a good idea to plan for a formal communication to TEFAP partners since this is a change in poliy that we have previously stated to them. Is there a deadline for when this needs to be implemented? I understand that it should be done as soon as possible, but any changes/refunds to delivery fees are always approved by Austin, who is currently out until January 9th. Thank you for bringing this matter back to our attention again, hope to resolve this as soon as possible! Best, ""D"" Hey ""D"", happy new year and thanks for your response! Yes, we re asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions. But, I don t think we need to issue refunds or change this immediately. I can flag this to Austin for when she returns and circle back to you. Agreed that we ll need to send out a communication, and my thought is we can word it as this will be our process going forward. Closing this ticket as this issue is currently being handled by Alexis and Austin. If any further steps are taken, the associated teams will be made aware."

You can expect a response by 10 a.m. the next business day for requests sent outside of business hours. Thank you, Customer Relations Capital Area Food Bank Good afternoon, Thank you for contacting customer support. While we do not have many ready-to-eat items on our menu at the moment, we are looking into what may be useful to order for the future. Can you please let me know specific or approximate volumes that you would like of each item? We will work on trying to build a more mixed menu to accommodate what your organization needs. Thank you, distribute approximately 180 - 220 bags each week. Our bags contain the following items: Bottled water, milk shelf stable 8oz, juice box 6-10oz, applesauce cup 4oz, tuna pouch 2oz, package of peanut butter cracker (lance)/ chips 1oz bags variety, package of cookies/granola bar, cereal in prepackaged bowl, 2 saltine packs ( 2 cracker in each pack). I hope this helps. When I order it is based on need and the amount of storage space we have. Usually it is 50-60 cases of milk( 27 boxes per case), 12-18 cases of applesauce(96 cups per case), pallet or water ( 48 cases of 24 bottles per case). These items usually last 2- 3months. Items we get from Sckenck Foods include: 14 prepackaged cereal bowls (96 per case), 8 peanut butter cracker (12 8packs per case) , 20-30 juice boxes (motts 36 per case), 6 saltines (500 2pk) 8 cookies (120 pks per case). Trips to BJ's, Costco , Walmart and Amazon provide some of the above and also the 50 tuna (10-12 2oz pouches per box). Sometimes we even get Vienna sausages. Granted none of this is considered healthy but it is convenient and ready to eat. We also distribute canned goods to those who have a place to cook ( about 6-15) a week. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else. ---- Thank you for the insight. Our Food Resourcing team will be using this information to incorporate more Ready-To-Eat products in the near future. As for now I do not see us having any of the products you mentioned coming in on our schedule. That may change and I encourage you to keep checking our menu on Partnerlink for updates."

906,"qm: Dr. Head, We appreciate the wonderful service you provide to your community and your partnership with CAFB for the last 15 years. Different programs within CAFB have different rules and regulations. TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS, collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB. I completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work. We also understand that not everyone is able to, qualifies for, or feels comfortable completing the SDI form. This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form. My goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God, it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS, to work together when other problems arise, and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level. Regarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August, like covered in the civil rights training, regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted. In the case of no distribution, you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served, note any inventory you have at the time, sign and submit. I can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report. I do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday, October 28th. Like stated in the previous emails, what needs to be submitted on Wednesday, October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan, a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms, and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted. Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously, they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me. I appreciate your patience, understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community. Best, Lucy"

I believe when we spoke on the phone previously, we agreed you would begin ordering again for the Kennedy Shelter to see the types of food we have available. I understood then from there we would see if it made sense to add another location or not based on the different needs.

After speaking with our Head of Procurement, he clarified that there can sometimes be a mix of winter squash, but he believes this one is butternut squash. Thank you, ""D"" you, ""D"". I did end up deleting this one from our shopping cart because the butternut squash is too big for many of our guests and our volunteers to handle.

Yes, we are collaborating with our internal teams to provide additional details about the items when they arrive at the food bank, and we are also ensuring that there are photos included. For some of our produce, the descriptions can be broader, and when items are received, they may be mixed. For example, we might receive potatoes, but three bins could contain one type, while the other four contain a different type, and they are all categorized simply as potatoes. We are definitely working on improving descriptions to enhance the overall experience. Best, ""D"""

Can you please provide me with the item number you were trying to add to your cart and I can look into what happened? , I was unable to print the pdf of the order because it never showed. When I put in the order for the 5 cases of catfish, there were only 5 cases available. I requested the last 5 cases but, 10 cases which showed in the cart when only 5 were available. I saved the order, but no pdf of the order showed to allow me to print. An error message showed to change and when I did the cart was empty. When I went back to retrieve the 5 cases, they were gone. Therefore, I wasn't able to get the item # for the catfish. Toni Gaines Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church 301-222-7285 ---- Hi Toni, Please note that even if an item is in your cart, items do not hold. There is a chance the catfish could have been purchased while you were ordering, changing the total quantity available. I believe this is what happened with you. We apologize that you were not able to purchase the catfish as our products are available on first come first serve basis. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. qm: Hi , I'm aware that items are on a first come first serve basis. However, the items were in the cart. I saved the cart and it showed 10 items in the cart when I only ordered the 5 items available. This is when the pdf of the order did not appear for me to download. The screen had an error message instead stating the 10 items were not available, but I only ordered 5 which were available. Can we be put on a waiting list should you get more catfish? Thanks for your response. Toni Gaines We appreciate your patience as we look into this issue. Can you please confirm if this was a TEFAP product or not? , Yes, the catfish was a TEFAP product. Thanks, Toni Gaines Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church Good afternoon, We contacted the TEFAP Team and learned that we anticipate receiving a shipment of catfish between October 16th and 31st. Currently, we do not have a waitlist or a reminder system linked to our inventory to alert partners when items are back in stock. This is feedback we have received from partners and have conveyed to our Food Resourcing and Inventory Teams for consideration. If you wish to check back during that time and do not see the catfish available, we would be happy to reach out to the TEFAP team to confirm if the shipment is still expected during that period. It seems that in your original order, the product went out of stock. Our inventory is live and operates on a first-come, first-served basis as you know. At times, items may be taken by the time you start the checkout process, resulting in an error message prompting you to update your item quantities based on what's available. Additionally, there may be different lots of items with varying expiration dates. Consequently, you may have two lots of the same product arriving at different times, with one having a later expiration date than the other. Depending on the date of your order, the item may have gone out of stock for the specific case lot you selected, even though there are still some available on the menu. This occurs due to the date you chose for your order. We acknowledge that our inventory system is complex and are striving to make it more user-friendly and accessible for partners to obtain information from the website. Thank you, Customer Relations"

994,"Good monring, Thank you for this! I will take a look at the produce we have and follow-up if I see anything to add! ""D"" Good afternoon, Erin, I hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow up regarding my earlier call about the produce. I was able to add the produce to another sales order for delivery with the rest of your order on Monday, under document number SO186618 becuase your other order had already been fulfilled. However, I later learned that the apples needed to be removed from the order due to a shortage; it seems we overallocated that item. The sweet potatoes 19 cases of 40 lbs each will still be delivered with your order on Monday. I apologize for the inconvenience and wanted to inform you before your delivery. Best regards, ""D"""
